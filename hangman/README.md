# HangMan

Just practising File I/O and Serialization through some crappy OOP game approach :D 
Went with YAML to save/load implementation

## Focus of exercise was:
* Reading data from text file
* Using YAML to serialize game status and store it to file
* Reading data to return saved state of program 

### Note: 
- Not really good OOP approach, but as I already procrastinated hard and that wasn't the main focus of the exercise
I will leave it in this kinda messy state.
